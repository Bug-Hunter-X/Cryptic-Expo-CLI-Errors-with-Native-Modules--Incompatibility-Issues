The solution often involves carefully reviewing the native module's documentation.  Verify compatibility with your Expo SDK version.  Check for any required peer dependencies and ensure they are installed correctly.  If the issue persists, try these steps:

1. **Clean the project:** Delete the `node_modules` folder and `yarn.lock` or `package-lock.json` file. Reinstall the dependencies.
2. **Check Expo SDK version:**  Ensure the Expo SDK version is compatible with the native module.  Upgrade or downgrade the SDK or native module as needed.
3. **Examine the detailed error messages:** Carefully look at the full error output from the Expo CLI.  Sometimes hidden within the logs are clues about the root cause.
4. **Verify native dependencies:**  Native modules often have additional dependencies.  Make sure these are properly installed and linked.  If using EAS Build, carefully review the build logs.
5. **Search for similar issues:**  Search online forums and the issue tracker of the native module for similar problems.  Others may have encountered and solved the same issue.

Example (Illustrative):
```javascript
// bugSolution.js
import * as Camera from 'expo-camera'; // Replace with your actual native module

// ... rest of the code using the camera module
```
This improved approach uses a widely supported module and ensures that any necessary setup or configuration steps are followed as per the official documentation for that module.
