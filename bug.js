This error typically occurs when you're working with Expo's managed workflow and attempting to use a native module that isn't compatible with the version of Expo you're using or isn't properly configured.  It can manifest in various ways, sometimes without a very clear error message from Expo CLI itself.  The root cause is often a mismatch between the native module's requirements and the Expo environment. 

Example Scenario: Imagine you're trying to integrate a camera library.  You install it using `expo install expo-camera`, but you might encounter a cryptic error during build, such as a linker error or an error related to missing native dependencies. The Expo CLI might not directly point to the incompatibility, leading to confusion.
