# Cryptic Expo CLI Errors with Native Modules

This repository demonstrates a common yet cryptic issue encountered when using native modules within the Expo managed workflow.  The problem stems from incompatibilities between the native module, the Expo SDK version, and potentially other dependencies.  The errors generated by the Expo CLI are often unclear, making debugging difficult.

## Problem Description

The core issue revolves around the lack of clear error messages from the Expo CLI when there's a mismatch between a native module and the Expo environment.  The error often manifests during the build process and might involve linker errors, dependency resolution failures, or other cryptic messages that don't directly point to the root cause.

## Reproducing the Issue

The `bug.js` file contains code that attempts to use a hypothetical native module (replace with an actual module if you wish to reproduce). The build process will likely fail with unclear error messages.

## Solution

The solution involves careful dependency management and ensuring compatibility between the native module and Expo.  This may involve checking the module's documentation for compatibility with your Expo SDK version, reviewing its installation instructions, and ensuring all required native dependencies are correctly linked.  The `bugSolution.js` file illustrates potential fixes.
